// ResolveFailovers returns the failover chain for a request that resolved
// through a redirect: the concrete models behind the redirect's remaining
// available targets, in declared order and descending chained virtual models,
// minus the model the request was sent to first. The redirect's strategy only
// chooses that first target; every other available target is a failover leg,
// so a load balancer and a priority list fail over the same way. A redirect
// with failover switched off, and requests that did not go through a redirect,
// have no chain — except a request that named its provider explicitly for a
// model shadowed by a redirect listing that model among its targets (see
